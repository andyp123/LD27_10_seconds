LD27_10_seconds
===============

Ludum Dare 27 game, with the theme 10 seconds. Not made during the event, but a few days after.

To play the game, download the zip and extract anywhere on your computer. Open the file index.html in a web browser to load the game. Hopefully it should work. I've tested it in Chrome, Firefox and Opera. The sound is a bit broken in Opera 12, but it should be fine in the modern versions that are based on Chrome.

I don't really want to explain the game here, as it is easy enough (and more fun) to figure out by yourself.

This languished for a long time in a half finished state, but I recently cleaned it up so it wouldn't be yet another unfinished project weighing on my mind.
